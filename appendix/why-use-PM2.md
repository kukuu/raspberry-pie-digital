# Why use PM2


- Perfect for Raspberry Pi deployments! (Lightweight & efficient.)

- Ensures the simulation keeps running even after SSH disconnects.

- Easily manage logs (useful for debugging production issues).

- Zero downtime if you need to update the app.

- Works well with Prometheus for metrics collection.
  
- Keeps your Node.js application running forever (auto-restarts if it crashes).

- Manages multiple instances (clustering) for better CPU utilization.
