# Conveyor Belt Simulation - Node.js Solution

(With Persistence, GPIO, Tests, Monitoring & Deployment)

## Implementation Summary

This solution simulates a conveyor belt with 3 worker pairs, where components (A/B) are randomly placed (⅓ chance each). Workers pick components, assemble product C (takes 4 steps), and place it back. The system includes:

- SQLite persistence (stores simulation results)

- GPIO integration (LEDs indicate worker activity on Raspberry Pi)

- Unit & integration tests (Jest)

- Prometheus + Grafana for real-time monitoring

- PM2 for production deployment
