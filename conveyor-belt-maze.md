Key Additions Explained

Worker Positions

- Workers are now defined with fixed positions on the belt (e.g., positions 0, 3, 6).

- Each checks its current and next slot for A and B (order-sensitive).

- Assembly Logic (assembleProducts)

i. If a worker finds A followed by B in adjacent slots:

a. Replaces them with C (product).

b. Increments productsC counter.

c. Clears the second slot (sets to null).

d. Integration with moveBelt

e. Calls assembleProducts() after every belt movement to simulate real-time assembly.

- Example Workflow

1. Belt State: [A, B, null, A, B, null, ...]

i. Worker at Position 0: Sees A (slot 0) and B (slot 1) â†’ replaces them with C and null.

ii. Result: [C, null, null, A, B, null, ...] and productsC increases by 1
